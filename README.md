1. Create an Employee class to represent an employee of a company. 
Add all relevant properties and behaviors that you might need but you have to include a salary property. Donâ€™t forget to add getters and setters.

2. Create an Intern class that extends from Employee. All the Interns have a salary limit of 20000 (constant).
You must validate if an intern is created (or salary updated) with a bigger salary than the max. The max value is set.

3. Write a program that creates 10 Employees and print it al the properties into a file named employees.txt.
